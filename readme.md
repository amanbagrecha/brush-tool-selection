Brush Selection Tool provides an intuitive "painting" interface for selecting polygon features in QGIS.  
Drag a circular brush across the map canvas—every polygon the brush touches becomes selected.

---

## Features
- Adjustable pixel-based brush radius (1–200 px) for consistent behavior across all projections
- Real‑time visual feedback: translucent cursor circle and brush‑stroke rubber band
- Choose to add to existing selections or replace them
- **Shift + Mouse Wheel**: Dynamic radius adjustment while tool is active
- **Shift + Click**: Add to selection mode (overrides default setting)
- Optimized for QGIS **3.40+**
